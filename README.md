<H1>Udacity TVOS App </H1>

This app was creating to view Udacity Youtube videos on the Apple TV

Technologies used in this project include YoutubeAPI to access metadata from youtube such as channel playlists and videos in playlists. AVFoundation and AVKit was used to stream video content natively.  Minor details still need to be ironed out such as bug fixes, seek forward/backwards during video playback, remember state of each video playback and autoplay the next video after the end of each video.

Feature I would like to include if I had access to Udacity are login functionality, incorporate students courses and progress, display Udacityâ€™s entire catalog and start new courses straight from the apple tv, finally sign up to Nanodegrees and charge users using Apples StoreKit framework. 

This is my first experience building for the TVOS platform and although its native, it's not perfect. It was a great learning experience, most applications on TVOS use TVML(TV Markup Language), this would be the next step in learning more about building apps for the TVOS platform.
